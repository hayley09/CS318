        <h1>Polynomials</h1>
        <p>If your problem can be modeled with a low-order polynomial equation, then it won't stay a problem for long. Let's look at the forms of the four simplest orders:</p>
        <p>Constant</p>
        <blockquote>Constant polynomials have the form a.</blockquote>
        <p>Linear</p>
        <blockquote>Linear polynomials have the form a &times; x + b.</blockquote>
        <p>Quadratic</p>
        <blockquote>Quadratic polynomials have the form a &times; x&sup2; + b &times; x + c.</blockquote>
        <p>Cubic</p>
        <blockquote>Cubic polynomials have the form a &times; x&sup3; + b &times; x&sup2; + c &times x + d.</blockquote>
